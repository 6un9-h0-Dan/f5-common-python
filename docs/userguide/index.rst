User Guide
==========
To get the most out of using our SDK it is useful to understand a few of the
concepts and principals we used when we designed it.  It is also important
that you are familiar with the F5 BigIP and at a minimum how to configure it
using the GUI.  More useful still would be if you are familiar with its
`iControl REST API <https://devcentral.f5.com/wiki/iControlREST.HomePage.ashx>`_.
