## Issues
Creating issues is good, creating good issues is even better.  By filing meaningful bug reports will lots of information
 in them helps us figure out what to fix when and how it impacts our users.  We like bugs because it means people are
 using our code, and we like fixing them even more.

## Pull Requests
If you are submitting a pull request you need to make sure that you have done a few things first.

* If an issue doesn't exist, file one.
* Make sure you have tested your code because we are going to do that when when you make your PR.  You don't want 
_The Hat_ because your request fails unit tests.
*  Clean up your git history because no one wants to see 75 commits for one issue
*  Use our [commit template](.git-commit-template.txt)
